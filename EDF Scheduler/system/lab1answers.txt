1. In XINU, why are interrupts raised and what are they used for? Give example of some interrupts in XINU.

ANSWER => (i) Interrupts are signalling mechanisms that allow external I/O devices to interrupt the processor when they need immediate service. At this time, the processor suspends the current activities, saving its state and handles the interrupt. For example, when a key is pressed on the keyboard.
